Converts all .cs and .xaml files in the script's directory (including subfolders) into .txt files and saves them in a new txt subfolder.

The target filename includes a hint about the original file type (_cs.txt or _xaml.txt).

Skips conversion if the target file already exists.

Additionally, two folders must be created: txt and dateien.
